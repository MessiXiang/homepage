I am a BS student in Computer Science at Beihang University (BUAA), Beijing, China. Previously, I studied Aeronautic Science and Engineering at BUAA from September 2022 to July 2024, graduating with top honors (GPA: 3.90/4.00, Rank: No.1). I then transferred to Computer Science in July 2024 and continue to maintain excellent academic performance (GPA: 3.92/4.00, Rank: No.1).

My research interests lie at the intersection of aerospace engineering and computer science, particularly in:
- CubeSat systems and satellite flight software
- Machine learning applications for satellite scheduling and operations
- Fault-tolerant and high-reliability embedded systems

Research Experience
======
I currently work as a Research Intern at **Colalab** (November 2024 - present), where I focus on algorithm optimization and developing a satellite simulation platform based on PyTorch.

Previously, I served as the Head of On-board-computer research team at the **CubeSat team of School of Astronautics, Beihang University** (October 2023 - October 2024). During this time, I published articles at domestic and international aerospace conferences, collaborated with doctoral students, and mentored undergraduate students.

Publications
======
I have contributed to research in both aerospace systems and machine learning:
- **IAC 2024**: Oral presentation on "Enhancing CubeSat Reliability and Efficiency"
- **arXiv**: Co-authored "SRFS: Parallel Processing Fault-tolerant ROS2-based Flight Software"
- **NeurIPS 2025**: Poster presentation on "Towards Realistic Earth-Observation Constellation Scheduling" (equal contribution)
